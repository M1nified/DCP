## Problems

 - [Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.](./problems/1.js)
 - [Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.](./problems/2.js)
 - [Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.](./problems/3.js)
